    <p>My favorite meal is chips and salsa. It takes no thought and tastes great, it does not even require dishes.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Jar of salsa from mom's fridge or pantry (any kind will do)</li>
        <li>Bag of chips from mom's pantry (any kind will do, even Lay's or Doritos</li>
        <li>*Optional* bowl</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open jar. You can dump contents into a bowl now but, honestly, what is the point?</li>
        <li>Open bag.</li>
        <li>Et voil√°, dinner is served.</li>
        <li>If you go the bowl route, you have the further option to elvate this recipe by microwaving a slice of american cheese on top of the salsa. Maybe even lay the chips down on a plate and melt the sliced american cheese over top the chips for some nachos. !Que Sabroso!</li>
