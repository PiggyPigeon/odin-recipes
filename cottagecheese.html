    <p>This is another versatile, affordable, and healthy super-recipe. It requires a spoon, sometimes. Sometimes you may also want a bowl. I make a stand and ask mom to only buy Daisy Brand cottage cheese because on this one fucking thing I decided to pretend to care about 'emulsifiers'. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>One tub of Daisy Brand cottage cheese (bigger=better).</li>
        <li>*Optional* bowl.</li>
        <li>*Optional* spoon. If you get hungry at the grocery store or on the road you can fold the lid of the cheese tub and use it as a scoop. </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Open tub of cheese.</li>
        <li>Use spoon (or folded lid) to eat cheese.</li>
        <li>That's it!</li>
    </ol>
    <p>I have, on more than one occassion, fantasized about mixing jelly beans into my cottage cheese, but so far the opportunity has eluded me. If you try it, leave your review in the comments below!</p>
