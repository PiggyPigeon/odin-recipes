    <p> A simple and affordable recipe to feed only yourself alone when no one can see how you feed yourself. Don't tell anyone that you do this sometimes because then everyone will know your parents divorced when you were not yet fully developed.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Can opener.</li>
        <li>Spoon.</li>
        <li>Can of any type of bean.</li>
        <li>*Optional* A lil salt or ketchup.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Use can opener to open can (unless a pull tab is present, then just rip it open).</li>
        <li>From here you can dig right in with your spoon!</li>
        <li>To make things a lil ~*fancier*~ for yourself #selfcare, you can pour the beans into a bowl (if you have one) and microwave them for like 30-40 seconds depending on how long you can wait.</li>
        <li>To make things even f0ncier, you can mix in a lil ketchup or hot sauce. Even a lil mayo if you're feeling indulgent.</li>
        <li>Note: to truly elevate, you can take a slice of american cheese and microwave that bad boy on top of your bean bowl.</li>
    </ol>
